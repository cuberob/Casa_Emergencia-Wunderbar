Casa Emergencia is an Android app which we built in a day at a hackathon (so no clean code...)

It monitors the sensors of a Wunderbar and spawns notifications on your phone when certain thresholds are met
(E.g. temperature becomes too high)

Requirements:
- A Wunderbar by RelayR
- A Wunderbar account (with a wunderbar registered to this account)

Todo:
- Lower the frequency of values retrieved from the Wunderbar cloud service (should become available as a feature in the wunderbar API)
- Make alarms customizable (Thresholds, messages, priority)

Howto:
- Import into Android studio and run!


Build during the Droidcon NL 2014 Hackathon
